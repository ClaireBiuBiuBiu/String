Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

            return haystack.find(needle)
        else:

        L, n = len(needle), len(haystack)

        for start in range(n - L + 1):
            if haystack[start: start + L] == needle:
                return start
        return -1
